      Charis is similar to Bitstream Charter, one of the first fonts designed
      specifically for laser printers. It is highly readable and holds up well in
      less-than-ideal reproduction environments. It also has a full set of styles
      - regular, italic, bold, bold italic - and so is more useful in general
      publishing than Doulos SIL. Charis is a serif proportionally spaced font
      optimized for readability in long printed documents.
      
      The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font family
      that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
      Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
      orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and
      symbols useful to linguists. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
      technologies to support complex typographic issues, such as the need to
      position arbitrary combinations of base glyphs and diacritics optimally.
      
      Four fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
      
           * Charis SIL Regular
           * Charis SIL Bold
           * Charis SIL Italic
           * Charis SIL Bold Italic
      
      The design of the basic character set of Charis SIL is similar (but not
      identical) to Bitstream Charter, designed by Matthew Carter. The following
      notice accompanied the Charter fonts:

      Charter (r) Type 1 outline fonts and the 4 Courier Type 1 outline fonts
      for any purpose and without restriction; provided, that this notice is left
      intact on all copies of such fonts and that Bitstream's trademark is
      acknowledged as shown below on all unmodified copies of the 4 Charter
      Type 1 fonts.

			A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
      ----------------------------------------------------
      
      The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Charis" and "SIL" in
      the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Charis
      SIL. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
      this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
      in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
      as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
      unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
      "Charis SIL" is not the resulting font family name.
      
      TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
      terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
      prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
      making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
      name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
      "Charis SIL Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
      with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Charis" and "SIL" 
      Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Grace Foo".
