    The Max Planck Society is a non-profit research facility, which is organized as a

    are largely autonomous in terms of organization and research, but as a rule have no
    legal capacity of their own.

<h4>Liability for Contents of Online Information</h4>
<p>
    In accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 of the Tele-Media Law, the Max Planck Society
    shall be responsible for its own contents according to general legal provisions.
    The Max Planck Society makes every effort to provide timely and accurate information
    on this Website. Nevertheless, errors and inaccuracies cannot be completely ruled out.
    Therefore, the Max Planck Society does not assume any liability for the information
    provided being up-to-date as well as its accuracy, completeness or quality. The
    Max Planck Society shall not be liable for damage of a tangible or intangible nature
    caused directly or indirectly through the use or failure to use the information
    offered and/or through the use of faulty or incomplete information unless it is
    verifiably culpable of intent or gross negligence. The same shall apply to any
    software downloads available free of charge. The Max Planck Society reserves the
    right to modify, supplement, or delete any or all of the information offered on its
    Website, or to temporarily or permanently cease publication thereof without prior and
    separate notification.
</p>
<h4>Links to Websites of Third Parties</h4>
<p>
    This Website includes links to other external websites. These external links are
    designated with an icon as follows:
    ${h.external_link('http://example.org', 'external link')}.
    References to the subordinate pages of this Website are designated without an icon as
    follows: <a href="#">internal link example</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The respective provider shall be responsible for the contents of any linked external
    pages. In establishing the initial link, the Max Planck Society has reviewed the
    respective external content in order to determine whether such link entailed possible
    civil or criminal responsibility. However, a constant review of linked external pages
    is unreasonable without concrete indication of a violation of rights. If the
    Max Planck Society discovers or is pointed out by others that an external offer
    linked to by the Max Planck Society causes civil or criminal responsibility, the
    Max Planck Society will immediately eliminate any link to this offer. The Max Planck
    Society expressly dissociates itself from such contents.
